           <h1><span>Best Things to Do in Bali</span></h1>
       </div>
   </div>

   <div class="text1">
    <p>Bali is one of the most popular travel destinations in the world, and with good reason, as this island which is known as the ‘Island of the Gods’ is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Surrounded by azure seas and edged with golden beaches, Bali is of course a surfer’s paradise, and if you are looking for a beach holiday then there is no better place to find it than this gorgeous island set in the middle of Indonesia.
    </p>
    <p>If you like adventure activities, then you also won’t be disappointed on a trip here, and you can expect a fantastic array of water sports, muck and wreck diving, and the chance fly through the jungle canopy like Tarzan.</p>
    <p>In short, whatever you want to do, you will probably find it in Bali and you can easily spend a month here and still only see a fraction of the sights on offer. The hardest part of a holiday here is choosing where to go first and what you want to see.</p>
   </div>
   

    <div class="text1">
        <h3><b>1. Go surfing in Kuta</b></h3>
        <p>If you haven’t surfed before or are just looking for some gentle waves then you have to come to the most famous beach in Bali which is Kuta Beach.</p>
        <p>Some eight-and-a-half kilometers long and between one to two kilometers wide, the lake is up to 125 meters deep and is surrounded by steep, wooded slopes that give it a fjord-like character. Of the lovely villages that dot its shoreline, the most popular are Obertraun; Steeg; and Hallstatt, with its old church and market square.</p>
        <p>The beach sits across from a sand bar which means it has rolling surf that is free of any sharp reefs and you can rent a board here and sign up for a surf lesson, or rent a body board if you want to try something a little less strenuous.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text1">
        <h3><b>2. Visit Ulun Danu Temple</b></h3>
        <p>Ulun Danu Temple lies at the edge of Baratan Lake in Bedugul in Bali.</p>
        <p>This pretty building is dedicated to the goddess of the lake and is one of the quietest and most serene places on the island.</p>
        <p>Make sure to check out all the different shrines, each one dedicated to a different god, and look out for the ornate architectural touches such as the intricate carved gates.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text1">
        <h3><b>3.Have fun at Bali Treetop Adventure Park</b></h3>
        <p>If you want an adrenaline packed afternoon then make your way to Bali Treetop Adventure Park where you will find a range of rides surrounded by lush forests.</p>
       <p>The park is great for families as well as groups or couples and has rides for children as young as 4 years old.</p>
       <p>There are a range of different circuits that are located high up in the trees and there are nets, swings, and flying foxes galore that let you fly through the air and take in the breathtaking views over the forest canopy.</p>

    <div class="text1">
        <h3><b>4. Go muck diving in Padang Bai</b></h3>
        <p>Padang Bai is situated in the east of Bali and is most famous for its diving.</p>
       <p>There are seven different dive sites that can easily be reached after a short boat trip from the shore and whatever your diving experience there is something for everyone here.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="main-image1">

    <div class="text1">
        <h3><b>5.Relax at the Yoga Barn</b></h3>
        <p>Bali is known as a place to relax and find enlightenment and with that in mind head for the Yoga Barn which is one of the most famous yoga retreats on the island.</p>
       <p>Located in quiet and contemplative Ubud, the Yoga Barn has five different studios and a range of programs for all levels of ability.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="main-image1">

    </div>



    <div class="text1">
        <h3><b>6. Spend time in Sidemen</b></h3>
        <p>Sidemen is often left of many traveler’s itineraries which is a shame as it offers you the perfect alternative to more crowded spots like Ubud.</p>
       <p>The area is located amongst jade green rice paddies and lies in a cool valley and you can go trekking in the surrounding area and walk to secluded waterfalls and stunning vantage points that let you take in the majesty of the scenery here.</p>

       <div class="main-image1">
